    "text": "Founded in 2023 by a team of healthcare professionals, data scientists, and AI researchers, PlasmAI was born from a simple observation: most people struggle to understand their blood test results. We saw patients leaving doctor's offices with complex lab reports, feeling confused and uncertain about their health status. Traditional healthcare systems often lack the time to provide detailed explanations, leaving patients to navigate their health journey alone. \nOur AI-powered platform bridges this gap, transforming complex medical data into clear, actionable insights that empower individuals to take control of their health.",
